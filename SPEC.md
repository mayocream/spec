## Versioning

For the model objects, Open Application Model adopts [Kubernetes API resource convention](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/architecture/resource-management.md).

Releases of the model are versioned according to [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and described in [OAM release page](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec/releases). Implementations of the model are required to specify which version they implement.

### Changes to the API objects

Changes to the API objects in this model follows [on compatibility](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#on-compatibility) and [incompatible api changes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#incompatible-api-changes) defined in Kubernetes API resource convention. It doesn't couple with release version of the model.

Changes to the change process (e.g. governance model, review/approve process etc) itself are not currently versioned but may be independently versioned in the future.
